jQuery selectors are one of the most important parts of the jQuery library.

jQuery Selectors

jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML elements as a group or as a single element.

jQuery selectors are required at every step while using jQuery. Selectors allow you to get the exact element/attribute you want from your HTML document.

jQuery supports the existing CSS Selectors, and in addition, it has some own custom selectors.

All type of selectors in jQuery, start with the dollar sign and parentheses: $().
Examples of jQuery Selectors

$("*") selects all elements.
$("p") selects all <p> elements.
$("p.intro") selects all <p> elements with class="intro".

$("p#intro") selects the first <p> elements with id="intro".

$(":animated") selects all elements that are currently animated.

$(":button") selects all <button> elements and <input> elements of type="button".

$(":even") selects even elements.

$(":odd") selects odd elements.
